*Sollux, [MSPA #3615](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=003615)*

<img src="https://hamcha.github.io/Sollux/sollux.min.svg" width="500">

Sollux <s>is</s> *will be* a tool used in HMI (Hamcha's server) for easier management of domains.
Planned features are:

- A more flexible nginx configuration file format (NPP)
- Management of Letsencrypt certificates
- Easier management of /etc/pf.conf (HMI runs FreeBSD) for jail port forwarding

## What's currently in

What you're talking about I just created the project

## Requirements

- A healthy fear of the end<sup>1</sup>
- [Stack](http://haskellstack.org/)

## A note about commits

Right now there isn't a structure and it's all a mess (ugly do blocks, function without proper names and the likes). Until an order has formed and stuff is working the commit history is going to be unreadable and full of random insults to myself.

I'm working on this tool mainly for me and my time working on the code is much more important than attention to commits right now, especially since I'm changing stuff all over the place and I'd spend way too much time organizing changes (a shame, `git add -p` and `git rebase -i` are my all time favorite git commands).

I promise I will start using proper etiquette and good manners once the mist has faded and the Haskell gods will have granted me peace from the chaos that is the current Sollux codebase.

Until then, don't read the commit history.
